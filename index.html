      <h3>The Taj Mahal: A Timeless Wonder</h3>
      
      <p>The Taj Mahal, often described as the jewel of Muslim art in India, is an iconic monument that stands as a symbol of eternal love. Built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, the Taj Mahal is an architectural marvel that attracts millions of visitors from around the world.</p>

      <p>Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 after the death of Mumtaz Mahal during childbirth. It is said that Shah Jahan was so heartbroken by her passing that he resolved to build a monument that would immortalize their love for all eternity. The construction of the Taj Mahal employed over 20,000 artisans and craftsmen from various regions, including Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Europe.</p>

      <p>The Taj Mahal's main building is constructed of white marble, quarried from Rajasthan, India. The marble was transported to Agra, where it was intricately carved and inlaid with precious and semi-precious stones, including jasper, jade, turquoise, lapis lazuli, and amethyst. The intricate floral motifs, geometric patterns, and calligraphy inscriptions adorn the facade, creating a mesmerizing effect.</p>

      <p>One of the most striking features of the Taj Mahal is its symmetrical layout, with the main building flanked by identical red sandstone buildings on either side. The complex also includes a mosque and a guesthouse, both constructed with red sandstone and adorned with marble domes and intricate carvings.</p>

      <p>The Taj Mahal is surrounded by a vast charbagh, or Persian-style garden, divided into four quadrants by water channels representing the four rivers of paradise in Islamic tradition. The garden is meticulously laid out with pathways, fountains, and lush greenery, adding to the serenity and beauty of the monument.</p>

      <p>Over the centuries, the Taj Mahal has stood as a symbol of enduring love and has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983. It continues to inspire awe and admiration, drawing visitors from all corners of the globe to witness its timeless beauty.</p>
